        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Nature is not just a backup to our lives or a gateway when we are stressed and the daily grind becomes diffult<br>
it's our home, our provider, and our companion. From whispering forests to the vast oceans, it sustains us in both tangible and intangbile ways.<br>
Its beauty insipers works of art, its rhythms ground us or get us off the ground, and its biodiversity enriches our very existence<br>
However, we often forget that we are not separate from the nature but deeply connected to it.<br>
Please remmebr that everyone one of us are able to go out, breathe, take a break and let go of our troubles<br>
due to this beautiful world we live. Do not take it for granted and Lastly,<br>
Namaste
